Issue view:
	- Added link at the top of the issue view (EVENT_MENU_ISSUE).

Created view 2:
	- Register time for work type and minutes type.
	- Added 'info' field in table 'work'
	- Substract 'todo' when 'done' is informed
	- When minutes_type=='est' => target_date=book_date
	- When minutes_type=='done' => done=done+minutes / todo=todo-minutes
	- When minutes_type=='completed' (new just for select) => completed_date=book_date / done=done+minutes / todo=0
	- Remove own time register (if admin_own_threshold)
	- Remove others time register (if admin_threshold)
	- Show/Hide all work types on target table (show_all_work_types_on_bug_targets)
	- When a 'todo' is defined without 'est', 'todo' is shown in red and with a tooltip containing the error
	
Config options:
	- [bug_view_mode][new] View selection: 1 (original) or 2 (purposed)
	- [show_all_work_types_on_bug_targets][new] Show/Hide all work types on target table. Only works on view 2
	- [admin_own_threshold][new] Enabled to remove custom registers. Only works on view 2

General:
	- More specific errors
	- More detailed history actions

Customers:
	- Added 'association_mode' field in table 'customer'
	- Created 'project_customer' table
	- Customer management page updated with 'association_mode' field
	- When a new project is created, the customers with association_mode='auto' are attached automatically
	- From project, you can attach/detach customers, except those marked with association_mode='all'
	- When a issue is resolved or closed, 'all customers' is transformed in the current customers list. It avoids future billing changes when adding a new customer to the project.
	- 'paying_customers' is required only if 'is_billable' is set to true, and the issue has adquired the minimum status (currently, the minimum status is defined hardcoded in 'pm_bug_is_billable_affecting_required_paying_customers')

Reports:
	- Added 'dashboard' report
	- Error control added for 'Resource progress' report
	- Added validation in 'print_progressbar_span' and 'print_progress_span' to avoid error when no resources are defined (only exploited when $g_show_detailed_errors=ON)

Report 'Time registration overview':
	- Layout adjustment to avoid paddings and margins
	- Collapsible panels
